[In a previous post](../bookrec-out-now/) I wrote about the Book Recommendations website that I created. Recently I had the chance to update the website! I did so because the last version seemed a bit hard to understand, and many people were confused on how to use the website.

[Check out the website now](https://binj.webook.club/), or bear with me and find out what changed!

## 1. Top toolbar

Do you remember? There used to be three links near the top-right of the page. They were “Home”, “Pick a Book”, and “About Us”.

And now, instead of three, there are three links! 🎉 But now, they are “Home”, “About Us”, and “Help”, so you don’t need to think to yourself, “Hmm, what does ‘Pick a Book’ mean?” (Surely it’s not the main functionality of the website, is it?)

## 2. Page Layout

Also, do you remember how the page had a maximum width back then? It wouldn’t stretch beyond that limit. (Check the last post to find out!) Now, I removed the limit so the website looks more natural.

But this presents another problem: On a page with a list of books, the list items are too fat.

Oh but that’s easy to solve! Just make it multiple columns!

So we ended up with this.

(Oh I also added some `border-radius` so it doesn’t look so dead formal)

## 3. Help!

I mean, I fixed up the “Help” page.

Previously it just had a sad bit of information on what the various parts on the books list page mean. Now it has a bit more, happier information on how everything on the website works.

(Do you know that there is a difference between “book lists” and “books list”? No? That’s why I wrote “List of books” instead.)

4. Database update
This might seem like the least important <s>and that’s why I saved it for last</s>, but I updated from our school’s library database. This added almost a hundred books to the database!
