I have made some C/C++ programs for the TI-84+ CE and posted them on GitHub, available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms). Some of them are still in progress, some of them are simply abandoned, and some are fully functional. Here are some of the fully functional ones and their descriptions. Many of these programs need the CE “Standard C Libraries,” which you can find [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest).

## prgmDNDTOOL

This is arguably the best program I ever created. Featuring character abilities storing, saving throws, and ability checks, this program has everything you need for rolling dice in Dungeons & Dragons.

This program is available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/dnd).

## prgmCALC24

Simple interactive program that calculates the number 24 from the four inputs. The output is in [postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), which is a bit hard to read for some people. However, I don’t want to translate it into infix notation (the normal), so you’ll have to go with it.

This program is available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/calc24).

## prgmCLOCKG

This program transforms your calculator into a clock. Yes, you still need to set the time manually every time your calculator’s RAM resets, but the clock is pretty cool.

This program is available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/clock).

## prgmDICE, prgmDICEG

These two programs are both dice rollers designed for Dungeons & Dragons. prgmDICE has a command-line interface, and prgmDICEG has graphics.

These programs are available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/dice) and [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/dice_graphix).
