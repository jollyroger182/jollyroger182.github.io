Continuing [this](../2022-02-19-my-creations-on-the-ti-84-ce/) article, here are more creations I made for the TI-84+ CE.

## prgmQRCODE

This is a simple QR code generator for your calculator.

This program is available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/qr).

Hidden feature: if you press [vars] in various text input modes (e.g. 2nd, alpha-upper, alpha-lower), some pre-inserted text will be inserted!

## prgmREAD

This is a program that perhaps deserves an article by itself. This program can generate a TI book file that you can put into your FAT32-formatted USB drive and open on your calculator. Alternatively, it generates a program with AppVars that you can run directly on the calculator.

This program also supports customizing the font! You can choose another font simply by replacing the file font.ttf with another TrueType font. Full-width characters are also supported. Here is an example of some Chinese text with the original font (text source: [Wikisource]("https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E9%98%BFQ%E6%AD%A3%E5%82%B3)):

## prgmENCOUNTR

This is a pretty simple and straightforward D&D encounter tracker.

This program is available [here](https://github.com/david-why/ti84plusce-prgms/tree/main/encountr).

## prgmHANGMAN

Yes, this is a classical Hangman game on your calculator!
