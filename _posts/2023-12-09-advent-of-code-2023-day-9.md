Hey everyone! It’s almost Christmas season, and that means Advent of Code is back in operations!

For anyone who might not know, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a 25-day coding challenge, starting December 1 and lasting until Christmas. Every day, there will be two coding challenges, and you get a star if you input the right answer.

There is a global leaderboard on the website: the first person to get both stars gets 100 points, the second person gets 99 points, and the 100th person to finish the day’s challenges gets 1 point. The top 100 users are displayed on the leaderboard.

By the end of Day 9, I finally emerged on the leaderboard as #90!

We in China have a slight time advantage: the challenges open at midnight EST (UTC-5), which means it’s 1 pm here. I am in school at that time, but we happen to have a self-study session then, so it works out perfectly! Although I had to set up VS Code Server to code so that I can write my solutions on my iPad.

Oh and by the way, here are my solutions to each day’s challenges: <https://github.com/david-why/aoc-2023>. Feel free to take a look!
