This tiny tool will save you tons of time when joining Tencent Meetings!

This is a Tencent Meeting helper script, written in the AutoHotKey language. This script has a few features:

- A GUI to save frequently used meetings to join with one click, accessible via Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J or the taskbar icon menu.
- A quick join dialog to join a meeting, hotkey Ctrl+Shift+J.
- A macro to open the chat box and pop it out into a separate window, activated by Ctrl+Shift+C.
    - This feature currently only works with Chinese Tencent Meeting, not VooV Meeting or Tencent Meeting set to any language other than Chinese.
